    <h1>Online Retail Analysis</h1>
    <h2>1. RFM:</h2>
    <p>This project implements the RFM Marketing technique. It helps assess the company's ability to manage customers by segmenting them based on their behavior. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), RFM segmentation, and a detailed report on RFM Analysis.</p>
    <h2>2. Geolocational analysis:</h2>
    <p>This section focuses on assessing the company's performance globally. A dashboard using Power BI has been created to generate a report comparing the company's performance. The primary goal of this report is to increase revenue while minimizing costs in the shortest possible time.</p>
    <h3>For both projects, the Report is available.</h3>
    <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <p>To work with this project, you'll need to have Python installed, along with these libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, plotly.express, matplotlib.pyplot, and datetime.</p>
